# Reflection

### regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
each question i  used around an hour to finish, to be honest i didn't improve with the time because it's getting harder and harder every week

### regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
one time i received a comment by a classmate that my code is missing or repeating, it really helped to improve my code

### regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject
nothing
